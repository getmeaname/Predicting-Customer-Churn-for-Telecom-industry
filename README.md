## Introduction
Customer churn prediction is crucial for telecom companies to maintain their customer base and increase profitability. This project utilizes machine learning models to analyze customer data and predict churn. By understanding the factors that influence customer churn, companies can implement strategies to improve customer retention.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`, which includes various features such as customer demographics, account information, and service details. Key features include:
- `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `gender`: Gender of the customer
- `SeniorCitizen`: Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not
- `Partner`: Whether the customer has a partner
- `Dependents`: Whether the customer has dependents
- `tenure`: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
- `PhoneService`: Whether the customer has phone service
- `MultipleLines`: Whether the customer has multiple lines
- `InternetService`: Type of internet service
- `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`, `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies`: Various service options
- `Contract`: Type of contract
- `PaperlessBilling`: Whether the customer uses paperless billing
- `PaymentMethod`: Payment method used by the customer
- `MonthlyCharges`: Monthly charges for the customer
- `TotalCharges`: Total charges for the customer
- `Churn`: Whether the customer churned or not

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/getmeaname/Predicting-Customer-Churn-for-Telecom-industry.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Predicting-Customer-Churn-for-Telecom-industry
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To explore and understand the data, open the Jupyter Notebook `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` and run the cells. This notebook contains the following steps:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Prediction and results

## Model Training
The project explores several machine learning models to predict customer churn, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

Each model is trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The notebook details the steps for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Results
The results section provides an analysis of the model performance, including confusion matrices and classification reports. The best-performing model is highlighted, along with insights gained from the feature importance analysis.
